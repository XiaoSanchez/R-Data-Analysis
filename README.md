# Data Analysis - R language

CIS 443 class with all projects that analysis the NYC open data, and generate data by traning & testing.

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. See deployment for notes on how to deploy the project on a live system.

### Prerequisites

What things you need to install the software and how to install them

```
brew install --cask rstudio
```

### Installing

A step by step series of examples that tell you how to get a development env running

Say what the step will be

```
git clone https://github.com/XiaoSanchez/R-Data-Analysis.git
```

And repeat

```
cd R-Data-Analysis
```

End with an example of getting some data out of the system or using it for a little demo

## Running the tests

If the directories where runtest and expect were installed are not in the PATH, you may need to set the following environment variables appropriately, as in the following example (which assumes that DejaGnu has been installed under /usr/local):

### Break down into end to end tests

rstudio depends on R. The R Project provides official binaries:

```
brew install --cask r
```

### And coding style tests

Alternatively, the Homebrew-compiled version of R omits the GUI app:


```
brew install r
```

## Deployment

Add additional notes about how to deploy this on a live system.
